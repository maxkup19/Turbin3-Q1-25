# Turbin3 Pre-Requisite Task in TypeScript

This task is designed to assess the ability of aspiring Solana developers to follow instructions
and intentionally fix errors that arise during the process. It also serves as a gentle introduction
to hands-on experience with building software for the Solana blockchain.


## Tips and Best Practices
- Ensure all development keys (wallets, and possibly environment variables) are ignored in the version control system to prevent exposure
- Provide proper code documentation with inline comments to explain specific decisions and processes
- Utilize utility functions and modules to make development and testing smoother and easier
