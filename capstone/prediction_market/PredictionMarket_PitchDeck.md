# Turbin3 Prediction Market

## Decentralized Prediction Markets on Solana

---

## The Problem

- Traditional betting markets are centralized, opaque, and have high fees
- Users don't have full control over their funds
- Limited market creation capabilities for regular users
- High barriers to entry for creating prediction markets
- Lack of transparency in market resolution

---

## Our Solution

**Turbin3 Prediction Market**: A decentralized, transparent prediction market platform built on Solana that allows anyone to:

- Create markets for any verifiable future event
- Place bets with minimal fees
- Maintain full custody of funds until market resolution
- Earn rewards for creating popular markets
- Benefit from Solana's speed and low transaction costs

---

## Key Features

- **Permissionless Market Creation**: Anyone can create a market about any future event
- **Binary Outcomes**: Markets resolve to Yes/No (Positive/Negative) outcomes
- **Transparent Resolution**: Clear resolution mechanism with on-chain verification
- **Low Fees**: Only 5% fee on profits, no fees on returned principal
- **Non-Custodial**: Users maintain control of their funds until withdrawal
- **Solana Speed & Cost**: Fast confirmations and minimal transaction fees

## How It Works

1. **Market Creation**: Users create markets by defining a question, expiration date, and providing a question hash
2. **Betting**: Users place bets on either the positive or negative outcome with SOL
3. **Market Resolution**: After the event occurs, the market creator resolves the market
4. **Withdrawals**: Winners can withdraw their initial bet plus their share of the losing side's pool (minus 5% fee)
